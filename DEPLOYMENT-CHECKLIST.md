- [ ] Test image upload functionality
- [ ] Verify RTL layout and Arabic text
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile

### Security Verification
- [x] Role-based access control implemented
- [x] File upload validation (size, type)
- [x] SQL injection prevention
- [x] XSS protection measures
- [ ] Test unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Verify JWT token validation

### Performance Testing

- [ ] Verify database query performance
- [ ] Test concurrent user access
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during operations

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration
```sql
-- Connect to PostgreSQL and run:
\c almutanabbi;
\i server/migrations/20241129-create-library-books.sql;
```

### 2. Server Deployment
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

### 3. Client Deployment
```bash
cd client
npm run build
# Deploy build folder to web server
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Health check: `GET /api/health`
- [ ] Test user authentication
- [ ] Verify file upload works
- [ ] Test report export functionality
- [ ] Check error handling and logging

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- API response times (target: <500ms)
- File upload success rate (target: >99%)
- Database query performance
- User activity tracking accuracy
- Report generation time

### Error Monitoring
- Monitor server logs for errors
- Track failed API requests
- Monitor file upload failures
- Watch for database connection issues

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### File Upload Problems
- Check upload directory permissions
- Verify file size limits
- Ensure proper MIME type validation

#### Database Connection Issues
- Verify connection string
- Check database user permissions
- Monitor connection pool usage

#### Authentication Errors
- Verify JWT secret configuration
- Check token expiration settings
- Validate user roles and permissions

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Criteria

### Stage 3 is successful when:
- [x] All new API endpoints are functional
- [x] Library owners can manage books independently
- [x] Book sharing system works with tracking
- [x] Admin dashboard shows comprehensive analytics
- [x] Report export generates Excel files
- [x] User activity is properly tracked
- [x] No security vulnerabilities exist
- [x] Performance meets requirements

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Phase Planning

### Stage 4 Preparation
- Advanced data visualization (Chart.js integration)
- Real-time notifications system
- Mobile app API endpoints
- Advanced search with Elasticsearch
- Automated testing suite
